# My Journey
My interests in Computer Science began not long after I graduated high school in 2002. Building my own computers for the purpose of playing games was the biggest driver of my interest at the time. By around 2008 I started to become interested in web development and teaching myself PHP so I could edit Wordpress templates and make custom blogs pages. In 2012 I decided to start pursuing courses in Information Technology at a local community college with plans to finish a four year degree when I could. My Associate of Arts was completed in 2013 and it wasn't until 2016 that I discovered SNHU's online program. The Computer Science program was not initially offered so I started in Information Technology and switched to CS as soon as it was available. I've learned a lot in the past four years that has allowed me to greatly enhance my skills and earn a better position at work. Previously, I had more of a background in design, which can be seen in my Behance portfolio, but now I am definitely more code focused. I am able to work in several programming languages and have joined my local Women Who Code group to help mentor other under-represented people in my field.

The three projects I re-worked for my ePortfolio as part of my Computer Science Capstone help show how far my skills have come and my proficiency in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Flask, and other technologies frequently used in the field of web development.
